# Awesome Rexxit Resources
Inspiration for this page came from [tleb's Awesome Mastodon](https://github.com/tleb/awesome-mastodon) page about Mastodon info. I hope this can be a useful resource for those either looking to join Lemmy/kbin.

## Official Sites
- [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/)
- [kbin](https://kbin.pub/en)
- [Tildes](https://tildes.net/)

## kbin Instance Info
- [Fediverse Observer - kbin](https://kbin.fediverse.observer/list)
- [kbin.social](https://kbin.social/) - not listed above for some reason, possibly due to kbin.social's federation/DDOS/CloudFlare issues

## Lemmy Instance Info
If you need help finding a home on one of Lemmy's many instances, these resources may help.
- [maltfield's Awesome Lemmy Instances](https://github.com/maltfield/awesome-lemmy-instances)

## Magazine (kbin) Discovery
At this time, I am not aware of any site aggregating kbin Magazines across instances.

## Community (Lemmy) Discovery
A Lemmy Community is most easily compared to a subreddit. These sites aggregate the communities, allowing users to know if a given community exists, and on which instance.
- [Lemmy Community-Browser](https://browse.feddit.de/)
- [Lemmy Explorer](https://lemmyverse.net/)
- [Unofficial Subreddit Migration List (Lemmy, Kbin)](https://www.quippd.com/writing/2023/06/15/unofficial-subreddit-migration-list-lemmy-kbin-etc.html)

## Transparency Thoughts
While this page outlines info about both Lemmy and kbin (and Tildes), I feel obligated to at least mention some of the reports of Lemmy's older users and devs being unfriendly towards human rights. [@feditips@mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/@feditips) has a [writeup about it here](https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106835057054633379#.). I am not here to verify, dispute, or lay any other claims to Lemmy, it's community, or members. I'm just helping pass along information for those that find it useful.
