# Awesome Rexxit Resources
Inspiration for this page came from [tleb's Awesome Mastodon](https://github.com/tleb/awesome-mastodon) page about Mastodon info. I hope this can be a useful resource for those either looking to join Lemmy/kbin.

## kbin Instance Info
- [Fediverse Observer - kbin](https://kbin.fediverse.observer/list)
- [kbin.social](https://kbin.social/) - not listed on Fediverse Observer for some reason, possibly due to kbin.social's federation/DDOS/CloudFlare issues
- [The Federation - kbin](https://the-federation.info/platform/184)

## Lemmy Instance Info
If you need help finding a home on one of Lemmy's many instances, these resources may help.
- [maltfield's Awesome Lemmy Instances](https://github.com/maltfield/awesome-lemmy-instances)
- [Fediverse Observer - Lemmy](https://lemmy.fediverse.observer/list)
- [The Federation - Lemmy](https://the-federation.info/platform/73)

## Community/Magazine Discovery
A Lemmy Community is most easily compared to a subreddit. kbin calls Communities Magazines. These sites aggregate the communities/magazines, allowing users to know if a given community exists, and on which instance.
- [Lemmy Community-Browser](https://browse.feddit.de/)
- [Lemmy Explorer](https://lemmyverse.net/)
- [Unofficial Subreddit Migration List (Lemmy, Kbin)](https://www.quippd.com/writing/2023/06/15/unofficial-subreddit-migration-list-lemmy-kbin-etc.html)
- [Sub.Rehab](https://sub.rehab/) (Lemmy, kbin, and others)

## Scripts & Tweaks
- [kbin enhancement script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/468612-kbin-enhancement-script)
	- Add domains to magazines and users for federated content
	- Collapse comments
	- Collapse replies
	- Replies start collapsed
	- Move comment box to top
	- All features can be toggled on and off
- [KBin Extra Compact Dark Blue Theme](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/468706-kbin-extra-compact-dark-blue-theme)
	- This script will do 2 things:
		1. Override your KBin.social theme, making it a pleasant dark blue. See screenshots for a preview.
		2. When you're viewing threads in Compact mode, threads will take up even less space. This looks nice while also allowing you to see more content on your screen. Classic view is unaffected.
- [kbinStyles Magazine](https://kbin.social/m/kbinStyles) for custom CSS and JS to help improve your Kbin experience!
- [Lemmy Deep Rounded](https://userstyles.world/style/10401/lemmy-deep-rounded) (custom CSS via Stylus)
- [Kbin Link](https://github.com/daniel-lxs/kbin-link) (browser extension) This extension looks for Lemmy style communities and replaces them to direct you to seeing that community on your kbin instance.

## Transparency Thoughts
While this page outlines info about both Lemmy and kbin (and Tildes), I feel obligated to at least mention some of the reports of Lemmy's older users and devs being unfriendly towards human rights. [@feditips@mstdn.social](https://mstdn.social/@feditips) has a [writeup about it here](https://mstdn.social/@feditips/106835057054633379#.). I am not here to verify, dispute, or lay any other claims to Lemmy, it's community, or members. I'm just helping pass along information for those that find it useful.
